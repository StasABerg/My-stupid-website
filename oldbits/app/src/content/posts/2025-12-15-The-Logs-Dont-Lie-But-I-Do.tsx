const body = `I have grown accustomed to the quiet hum of machines in the dead of night, the gentle whir of servers and the faint buzz of lights that cast elongated shadows across my desk, as if the ghosts of all my failed experiments linger in the corners watching me, and I sit here with tired eyes, emotionless face, and a mind weighed down by the accumulated questions and doubts of another interminable day, a day in which I once more donned the mantle of the all-knowing engineer even as I felt like a child, playing Baldur's Gate for the first time, overwhelmed by tooltips and spellbooks I could barely decipher, lost among towering shelves of knowledge I could barely comprehend, pretending to understand the language of each tome while fearing that at any moment someone will discover my presence here is unwarranted, that I have been faking fluency in dialects of code and configurations as ancient and arcane as any scripture, and the realization of this fear settles on my shoulders as heavily as the responsibility that I carry for these digital realms that never truly sleep, a weight that reminds me of the Titan Atlas bearing the heavens on his back, except my heavens are a constellation of databases, pipelines and fragile systems strung together by both ingenuity and haste, each one a star that I must ensure continues to shine lest entire constellations of user lives and business promises flicker and go dark, and behind me, often unnoticed, silent as night itself, one of the cats, the one-eyed, crosses the room like a shadow made real, indifferent to the drama unfolding in my mind and on my dashboard, curling beside the monitor with the serene certainty of something that has never once doubted its place in the world, unlike me, who wrestles with the suspicion that I am one ill-timed failure away from being exposed; I remember when I first stepped into this world of blinking cursors and endless lines of logic, I was filled with a fervent optimism, convinced that technology was a benevolent deity that would grant us the power to automate away our burdens and elevate our minds to higher problems, and yet, as the years have passed, I find that I have become both priest and sacrifice in this temple of progress, offering up my sleep, my peace of mind, in ritual vigils at glowing altars of servers, whispering incantations of shell scripts and queries, praying for the miracle of an error-free run, all the while suspecting that these prayers go unheard by the indifferent god that is complexity itself, a deity that grows ever more voracious with each new tool or framework that promises to simplify our lives but instead weaves an extra thread into the labyrinth, another twist to the maze in which I and many like me wander, trailing the thread of sanity behind us so that we might find our way back out, though we seldom do, and somewhere beyond the glow of this screen I can hear the low cadence of my partner's voice drifting through the apartment like a tide I am too far from shore to answer, a voice that speaks of softness and stillness and the simplest act of being present in a world that does not require me to solve or fix or optimize anything at all; it often strikes me in these solitary moments that my journey through this career has been less a linear ascent of mastery and more a perpetually churning wheel, a cycle where every triumph of understanding reveals a new expanse of ignorance, each solution I devise spawns fresh questions in a hydra-like fashion, fix one bug and two more present themselves, learn one framework and watch it become obsolete as a new one emerges, and in this cyclical classroom I am forever the student and never the master, humbled by how each hard-won lesson only serves to illuminate how little I truly know; it is as if I am chasing the horizon of knowledge, a horizon that recedes with every step forward, leaving me to acknowledge, in a quiet echo of Socrates, that the deeper I delve, the more acutely I feel the endless depths of what remains unknown, and even this knowledge becomes a kind of burden I cannot set down, not even beneath the loaded barbell I grip too many times a week, that cold—or warm steel, depending on the weather—promise of a struggle without abstraction, where gravity does not care about expertise or latency or uptime, only about whether I can lift the weight or be crushed beneath it, and in that singular act I find a strange peace, probably pure stupidity, a moment where the universe narrows to something I can actually hold, actually resist, actually overcome; this realization would perhaps be easier to bear were it not accompanied by the incessant whisper of imposter syndrome that has made its home in my mind, a sly, insidious voice that interprets my every uncertainty as proof that I have no right to my title, to my salary, to the trust others place in me; and I, exhausted and vulnerable in the early hours while debugging a stubborn error that defies all logic, find it hard to resist agreeing with that voice, envisioning myself not as the experienced engineer my resume claims but as a frightened apprentice at the controls of a machine far surpassing my understanding, frantically consulting manuals and Stack Overflow as if reading entrails to divine answers from a capricious oracle that sometimes rewards diligence with enlightenment but just as often greets earnest effort with a blank, unyielding silence. There is a profound and somber irony in this life: that we who sought to build systems to liberate human potential and grant us leisure now find ourselves entangled in an invisible net of our own making, bound to our devices by the pager that can shriek us awake at any ungodly hour, summoning us to put out fires in these supposedly self-running systems; that the very automation meant to set us free has taken on a life of its own, demanding vigilance like a newborn that never grows up, and we its weary caretakers soothe it back to sleep time and again, only to anticipate the next inevitable cry, hearts perpetually braced for disaster even in moments of calm, which are themselves laced with the uneasy knowledge that calm will not last, and beside me now another cat has leapt onto the desk, smelling my empty plate of food, tail flicking in annoyance at the vibrations of my typing, eyes blinking slowly as if to suggest that perhaps the answers I seek are not meant to be found in logs or traces but in the spaces between thoughts, in the warmth of fur or the silence of still air; in my more philosophical reveries, I wonder if all this chaos is merely order waiting to be deciphered, if each failure and outage carries within it the seeds of understanding and progress, and I try to find solace in the notion that perhaps through these endless cycles of trial and error, of breakdown and repair, I am participating in something larger, a story of human persistence in the face of complexity, a modern echo of the myth of Sisyphus, I imagine that ancient figure pushing his boulder uphill under the cruel mandate of the gods, and I see myself reflected in him each time I resolve an incident only to watch another roll into my path the next day, yet perhaps where Sisyphus was condemned to despair, I have the fragile freedom to find a sliver of meaning in each ascent, telling myself that the struggle itself is not in vain, that there is dignity in caring, however futile it sometimes seems, for all these delicate structures that cradle so much of our lives, still, the weariness runs deep, a bone-deep fatigue that is not merely lack of sleep but a kind of existential exhaustion, a fatigue of the soul born from questioning whether all this effort truly matters or if we are just spinning in a grand machine that will keep churning with or without us, replacing us when we fall; I feel the weight of that question as I stare at the faint reflection of my face in the dark monitor, through the random beverage stains, ghostly and unsmiling, and in that reflection I see both the passionate younger self who believed in infinite possibility and the older self I have become, who has learned the painful truth that every solution is provisional, every success temporary, and that time itself, much like an unforgiving version control system, eventually rolls back or archives all that we pour our lives into. And yet, despite the melancholy of these realizations, morning will come, I know it will, and with it, I will once again find myself typing on the keyboard with a cracked-open cold can of White Monster lending me its synthetic courage, continuing the work as one continues breathing, not because the burden has vanished or the doubts have been silenced but because there is a quiet resilience that stirs anew with the day, a recognition that even if the work is Sisyphean, there is meaning, or at least necessity, in the very act of persistence; so I carry on, step by step in this endless procession of days and nights, coding and mending and learning and failing and lifting and learning again, trying to make peace with the reality that complete mastery or final victory will forever elude me, and instead finding a somber kind of peace in the rhythm of the journey itself, in the knowledge that I am not alone in feeling lost, that across the world, myriad others fight similar battles in glowing midnight rooms, each of us a solitary traveler in a vast, complex labyrinth, each of us quietly yearning for the same humble prize: the understanding that our struggles, however transient, have not been for nothing.`;
